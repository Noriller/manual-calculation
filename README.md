# Manual Calculation

The idea is to make a calculator that works as we make calculations on pen and paper.

- The biggest advantage of this is that we are not constrained by the number wrapping and binary rounding errors.
- The biggest disavantage is, of course, performance.

Still need some adjustments and a proper wrapper for this...

- Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication are working.
- Division is working, but with abismal efficiency (I'm not a mathematician, so I'm struggling here.)
